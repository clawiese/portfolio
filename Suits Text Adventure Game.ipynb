    "In this high-stakes text adventure game, you step into the shoes **of Mike Ross**, a brilliant mind and **aspiring lawyer**. The game unfolds in **Mike meeting Harvey Specter** inspired by the iconic **first episode of \"Suits.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal? Stay in conversation with Harvey so you **don't get caught by the cops** as you've just lost them while **trying to deliver Trevor's drugs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Donna**, Harvey's assistant, just let you in after assuming you were **Rick Sorkin**, who was five minutes late.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This game is a thrilling blend of strategy and quick thinking, requiring you to navigate various scenes while maintaining your composure. Be **alert**, **smart**, and, above all, be **convincing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will you succeed and land a job with the legendary Harvey Specter at Pearson Hardman, or fail and be handcuffed? Good luck!\n",
